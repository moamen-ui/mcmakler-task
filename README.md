# Task

This is my task for McMacler company.


## Development server

to run the development server you must instal:
1. [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)
1. Angular cli `npm install -g @angular/cli`

After that make sure you are in the project folder, then run `npm i` to insatll all packages.
Finally run `ng serve -o` to strat angular project and open it on your default browser.

## Used Technologies

* Angular 5, because it famoust framwork to build a single page application (SPA).
* SASS for style, to make CSS more maintainable, themeable, and extendable.
* [Materialize-css](http://materializecss.com/), because the task recomend to use Material design concepts, I've used it via `npm i materialize-css` to import only used styles into my style.
